Generates immunology acronyms from phrases obtained from user input

# Context
I was studying immunology the other day, very reluctantly. Immunology has rather ridiculous acronyms. Protein Kinase - θ is abreviated as PKC-θ. Not to mention the horrible phenomenon where *Terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase dUTP nick end-labeling* is abbreviated as TUNEL.

This software, initially called the immunology-acronym-generate-inator, but then abbreviated using itself, serves to make fun od immunology abbreviations. Please have all the fun you like with it.
